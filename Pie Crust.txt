Pie Crust
=========

Ingredients
-----------
       2 cup  flour
       1 tsp  salt (skip if using salted butter)
       2 ---  sticks unsalted butter, cubed
     1/2 cup  sour cream or cold water (I only use water)

Optional
--------
       Sweet Crust:
       2   tsp  sugar, white (for sweet pies)

       Pumpkin Spice Crust:
       2   tsp  brown sugar
       2   tsp  cinnamon, ground
       1   tsp  ginger, ground
       1/4 tsp  nutmeg, ground
       1/4 tsp  cloves, ground
       1/8 tsp  cardamon, ground

       Savory Crust:
       1   tsp  parsley, dried/chopped
       1   tsp  black pepper, ground
       2   tbl  chives, chopped/dried


Directions:
   1) Whisk flour, salt and other dry ingredients in bowl.
   2) Cut butter into cubes.
   3) Work butter into flour with either hands or pastry cutter until flour
      has the appearance of course meal.
   4) Slowly add sour cream/cold water a few teaspoons at a time, working it
      into the dough with a fork.
   5) Form dough into two ball/disks, wrap tightly with plastic, and
      refrigerator for at least 1 hour or upto 1 day.
   6) Remove from refrigerator about 5 - 10 minutes before use.
   7) Roll out on a lightly floured surface.
   
Notes:
    * Makes two 12 to 14 inch single crusts or one double crust.
    * Do not use sour cream if you need to pre-bake the pie crust. The
      combination of sour cream and butter will cause the sides of the crust
      to collapse.
      crust or using a pie protector will keep the crust from browning too
      much.
    * Adding 1 tbl of ground black pepper and 2 tbl of dried chives to make
      a flavorful crust for savory dishes such as quiche.
    * When substituting bacon grease for butter, chill before use or add flour
      until dough is workable.
