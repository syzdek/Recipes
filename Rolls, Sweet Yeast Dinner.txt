Sweet Yeast Dinner Rolls

Ingredients:
     1/2 cup  milk
     1/2 cup  sugar
   1 1/2 tsp  salt
     1/4 cup  butter, melted
     1/2 cup  warm water
       2 pkg  active dry yeast
       2 ---  eggs, large & beaten
   4 1/2 cup  all purpose flour
       - ---  additional butter for brushing

Directions:
   1) Scald milk (bring just to a boil and remove from heat). Stir in sugar,
      salt, and butter. Set aside and allow to cool to lukewarm.
   2) In a large bowl mix warm water and yeast. Stir until dissolved. Stir in
      lukewarm milk mixture, beaten eggs, and half the flour. Beat until smooth.
   3) Add remaining flour gradually, mixing as you go, until dough is elastic
      and slightly stiff but not dry.
   4) Turn dough out onto a floured board and knead until smooth and very
      elastic (8-10 minutes).
   5) Butter the inside of a large mixing bowl. Put dough in bowl and turn
      dough over a couple of times to coat it all with the butter. Cover bowl
      and place in a warm place so it can rise (about 1 hour to double).
   6) Punch dough down. Pinch off about 2-3 tablespoons of dough and shape into
      a ball. Place each one in a buttered muffin tin or baking pan, barely
      touching each other, do not crowd rolls.
   7) Cover prepared rolls and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in
      bulk (about 1 hour). Rolls should now touch each other. (A little more
      rising will occur during baking.)
   8) Preheat oven to 375 degrees (about 10-15 minutes before rolls are done
      rising).
   9) Bake for 15-25 minutes until light golden brown.
  10) Remove from oven and immediately brush with butter.
  11) Let them rest for 10-15 minutes before serving.
  

Notes:
    * Prepare yeast in water, and not scalded milk mixture.
