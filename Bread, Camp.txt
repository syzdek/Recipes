Notes:
    * To take camping, I add dry ingredients to gallon freezer bag and pack to
      camp.  I add boiling water to the freezer bag, seal it, and "squish" the
      bag to combine dry ingredients and water.  I then squeeze the air out of
      the bag and seal it.  Then let proof in freezer bag.
