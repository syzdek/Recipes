Quick Pizza Crust
(http://allrecipes.com/recipe/quick-and-easy-pizza-crust/)

Ingredients:
   2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast (1/4 ounce package)
   1 tsp     sugar (or 1 Tbl honey)
   1 cup     warm water (100F/45C)
   2 1/2 cup bread flour
   2 Tbl     olive oil
   1 tsp     salt

Directions:
   1) Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medium bowl,
      dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about
      10 minutes.
   2) Stir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes.
   3) Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a
      round. Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker's peel
      dusted with cornmeal. Spread with desired toppings and bake in preheated
      oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool
      for 5 minutes before serving.

Variations:

   Thin Crust:
      1) Prepare dough as above.
      2) Roll dough into thin rounds, transfer to lightly greased pizza pan, 
         and add thin layer of sauce.
      3) Par-Bake for 5 minutes at 500 degrees F.
      4) Remove from oven and add remaining toppings (avoid toppings which
         release juice).
      5) Finish baking for 10 minutes at 500 degrees F.
      
   Bread Sticks:
      Roll out dough to a thickness of about 1/2 inch.  Use a pizza cutter to
      slice the down into 1/2 inch strips, but do not seperate the strips. Bake
      for 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Brush with melted butter and add
      garlic/onion powder/grated parmesan cheese if desired.
