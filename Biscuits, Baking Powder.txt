Baking Powder Biscuits

Ingredients:
   2 cups sifted flour
   4 tsp. baking powder
   1 tbl. honey
   8 tablespoons butter or shortening
   1/2 tsp. salt
   about 3/4 cups milk or butter milk

Directions:
   1) Sift Flour once, measure, add baking powder, salt and sugar.  Sift again.
   2) Cut in shortening or butter.
   3) Add milk gradually, stirring until soft dough is formed.
   4) Turn out on slightly floured board and lightly fold repeatedly, turning
      90 degrees after each fold (this creates layers within the biscuit for
      easy cutting in two).  Shape dough into a ball.
   5) Roll 1/2 inch to 1 inch thick and cut into 2" to 3" squares or use a
      ring from a widemouth mason jar to cut out circles.
   6) Bake on greased sheet in a 400 degree oven for 12-15 minutes.

Notes:
   Makes 12 biscuits. You can also make tiny tea biscuits that are only
   1 1/2 inches wide with a small cutter or glass bottom. These are great
   served with tea, jam or honey. Makes 24.
