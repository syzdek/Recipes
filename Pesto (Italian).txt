Italian Pesto

Ingredients:
   1 large bunch of basil leaves
   3 medium cloves of garlic
   3/4 cup loosely packed Parmesan
   1 small handful of raw pine nuts
   2-3 tbs extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
   1) Start chooping the garlic with 1/3 of the basil leaves.
   2) Slowly add more basil and continue chopping.
   3) Repeat for remaining basil.
   4) Add half the pine nuts and continue chopping.
   5) Add remaining pine nuts and continue chooping.
   6) Add half the Parmesan and continue chopping.
   7) Add remaining Parmesan and continue chopping.
   8) Chop until ingredients are fine enough to be pressed into a small cake.
   9) Transfer the cake into a bowl just large enough to hold the mixture.
  10) Cover with a little olive oil.
  11) Just before serving, stir the pesto to combine the oil and basil.

Recommendations:
   Use a sharp knife to prevent bruising the basil leaves while chopping.
