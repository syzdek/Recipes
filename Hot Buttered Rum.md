Hot Buttered Rum

Ingredients:
       2 tbl  butter, unsalted room temperature
       2 tbl  brown sugar
     1/4 tsp  cinnamon
     1/4 tsp  nutmeg, grated
     1/4 tsp  cloves, ground
     1/4 tsp  allspice, ground
       2 oz   spiced rum (1/4 cup)
     4-6 oz   hot water (1/2 cup - 3/4 cup)
     1/2 cup  whipped cream
              cinnamon sticks for garnish, optional
              freshly grated nutmeg for garnish, optional

Directions:
   1) Make whipped cream.  Whipped cream should be firmer, more like butter,
      than whipped cream served with desserts.
   2) Muddle butter and brown sugar in mug.
   3) Add sinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice and muddle into butter.
   4) Pour 2oz of rum into mug.
   5) Top off mug with host water (less for more robust flavor), and a dollop
      of whipped cream.
