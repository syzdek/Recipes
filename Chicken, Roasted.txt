Directions:

   * I am still dialing in the cooking tempature and length of time with the idea
     of setting the delay start on the oven with a timed cook setting so dinner is
     ready when getting home from  Church around 6:00pm.

      pepper, and 1 tsp onion powder.

   8. Tuck wing tips under legs.
   9. Sprinkle remaining salt mixture over skin on breast, legs, and wings.
