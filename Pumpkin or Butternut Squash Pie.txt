Pie Ingredients:
       2 ---  eggs, plus yolk of third egg
     1/2 cup  dark brown sugar, packed
     1/3 cup  sugar, white
     1/2 tsp  salt
       2 tsp  cinnamon, ground
       1 tsp  ginger, ground
     1/4 tsp  nutmeg, ground
     1/4 tsp  cloves, ground
     1/8 tsp  cardamon, ground
     1/2 tsp  lemon zest
       2 cup  squash purée (sugar pumpkin or butternut squash)
   1 1/2 cup  heavy cream (or 1x 12oz can of evaporated milk)
       1 ---  pie crust

Purée Ingredients:
       1 ---  medium-small sugar pumpkin or large butternut squash


Pumpkin Purée:
   1) Preheat oven to 350 F.
   2) Cut a medium-small sugar pumpkin or large butternut squash in half.
   3) Scrape out insides and set seeds aside.
   4) Line baking sheet with Silpat or foil. Place squash halves cut side
      down on lined baking sheets.
   5) Bake until fork can easily pierce the squash's skin (about 60 - 90
      minutes).
   6) Remove from oven and let cool.
   7) Scoop out the pulp and mash with potatoe masher.
   
   *  Makes about 4 cups of squash purée.


Directions:
   1) Preheat oven to 425 F.
   2) Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt,
      cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
   3) Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until
       everything is well mixed.  Pour the filling into an uncooked pie shell.
   4) Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
   5) Lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more, or until
      a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. 
   6) Cool the pumpkin pie on a wire rack for 2 hours. 


Notes:
    * About half-way through the baking, placing foil around the edges of the
      crust or using a pie protector will keep the crust from browning too
      much.
