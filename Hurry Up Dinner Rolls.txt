Hurry Up Dinner Rolls
(From the Culinary Arts Institute Bread & Soup Cookbook)

Ingredients:
   2 1/2 - 3 cups all-purpose flour
   2 Tbl sugar
   1 package active dry yeast (1 tsp)
   1/2 tsp salt
   3/4 cup hot tap water (120-130 degrees)
   1 egg
   2 Tbl oil
   2 Tbl butter, melted

Directions:
   1) Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, yeast and salt in a bowl. Stir in water,
      egg and oil; beat until smooth. Cover and let rise in a warm place for
      15 minutes. (I place my bowl over steaming water to promote rising.)
   2) Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft sticky dough.  Turn dough
      onto a floured board and continue to work in flour until dough can be
      kneaded.  Knead until smooth and elastic.
   3) Divide dough into 12-16 pieces and shape as desired. Place in a
      buttered 9 inch square pan. Brush tops with melted butter.  (I melt
      the butter in the dish I plan to bake the rolls in, and then roll the
      dough in the butter.)  Cover, let rise 20 minutes.
      (Again, I place the pan of rolls over steam.
   4) Bake at 350-400 degrees for 10-15 minutes.  (That is really dependent
      on your oven.  I bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.)


Notes:
   This generally takes and hour of prep work, and then 10-15 minutes for
   cooking.
