Butter Cake

Cake Ingredients:
   1 1/2 cup   all-purpose flour
   1 1/2 cup   cake flour
   1 tbl       baking powder
   1/2 tsp     salt
   1/4 tsp     baking soda
   20 tbl      butter, softened
   2 cup       sugar, granulated
   2 tsp       vanilla extract
   1/4 tsp     almond extract
   4           eggs, large
   1 cup       buttermilk

Directions:
   1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Lightly coat three 9-inch
      cake pans with softened butter. Dust pans with flour and tap out excess.
   2) Sift together both flours, baking powder, salt, and baking powder.
   3) Cream butter, sugar, vanilla, and almond extract. Beat with mixer for
      3-4 minutes.
   4) Add 1 egg at a time, scraping bowl sides and beating with mixer after
      each addition.
   5) Alternate between adding sifted ingredients and buttermilk. Mix on
      medium speed after each addition.
   6) Beat on higher speed for 1-2 minutes.
   7) Divide batter evenly into pans.  Bump pans on counter a few times to
      settle batter and release air bubbles.
   8) Bake for 25 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
   9) Cool in pan on baking rack.
