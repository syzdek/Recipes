Baking Powder Biscuits
(from a 1933 Recipe)

Ingredients:
   2 cups sifted flour
   2 tsp. baking powder
   4 tablespoons butter or shortening
   1/2 tsp. salt
   about 3/4 cups milk

Directions:
   1) Sift Flour once, measure, add baking powder and salt, and sift again.
   2) Cut in shortening or butter. (this is where I use my hands by rubbing
      the butter into the flour).
   3) Add milk gradually, stirring until soft dough is formed.
   4) Turn out on slightly floured board and lightly "knead" for 30 seconds,
      enough to shape.
   5) Roll 1/2 inch thick and cut with 2 inch floured biscuit cutter.
   6) Bake on ungreased sheet in a 400 degree oven for 12-15 minutes.

Notes:
   Makes 12 biscuits. You can also make tiny tea biscuits that are only
   1 1/2 inches wide with a small cutter or glass bottom. These are great
   served with tea, jam or honey. Makes 24.
