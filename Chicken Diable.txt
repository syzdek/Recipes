Chicken Diable

Ingredients:
   1 broiler chicken
   1 tsp curry powder
   1/4 cup melted butter
   1/4 cup prepared mustard
   1/2 cup honey

Directions:
   1) Preheat oven to 375 F.
   2) Melt butter in shallow baking dish.
   3) Stir in remaining ingredients.
   4) Roll chicken in mixture.
   5) Arrange meaty side up.
   6) Bake at 375 F for 1 hour.

Recommendations:
   I've been told the original recipe recommends serving with mashed potatoes
   using the resulting sauce as a gravy.  My family always served this dish
   with white rice.
