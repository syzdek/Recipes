      salmon.  Stop adding bread crumbs if they start collecting in the
      bottom of the bowl.
   4) In small bowl, beat eggs and mix in lenmon juice.
   5) Slowly pour in lemon egg mixture while gently kneading with your
      hands. Add just enough egg mixture that the salmon mixture bind
      together into a ball.
   6) Scoop out about 1/4 C to 1/2 C of the salmon mixture and press into
      a small ball and then press into a flat cake/pattie. Repeat for
      remaining salmon mixture.
   7) Heat a skillet on medium to medium low.  Once skillet is hot, melt
      enough butter to coat the bottom of the skillet.
   8) Pour the coating/crust bread crumbs into a small flat bowl.
   9) Coat the salmon patties in bread crumbs by laying them in the bread
      crumbs and gently pressing down, then flipping and repeating on
      recerse side.
  10) Place salmon cakes/patties in the buttered hot skillet and cook until
      golden brown, then flip and cook reversed side.  Add butter between
      batches as necessary.


Notes:
   Making patties with 1/2 C to 3/4 C of salmon mixture makes a hearty size
   pattie for a hot salmon sandwich.
